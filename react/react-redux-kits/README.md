# react-redux-kits

I'm merging every simple project into this repository.

## Intro
I've been planning for developing django-based react app to synchronize continuously changing data and provide unique education system to employees in aspect of information security and privacy.

To achieve my goal, I need to set some strategies to implement things step-by-step.

There is a simple process to designing, developing, deploying process.

## Clone and Fast boot.

I currently maintain a boilerplate code [react-starter-boilerplate-pack][1]

Following below instruction

### Step 1. cloning boilerplate pack as your project name.

```
git clone https://github.com/code-machina/react-starter-boilerplate-pack.git redux-tutorial-2
cd ..\redux-tutorial-2
# edit README.md
yarn # install node modules required
yarn dev # running app to check whether it is working
```

## Step 1. Dreaming something

## Step 2. Evaluate the Design

## Step 3. Develop Simple Project to implement the design

## Step 4. Merge it into `react-redux-kits`

## Step 5. Deploying it into Real Production App.
